# Initial Request

**User Request:** Revisit core-generator, findings where added marking this as not ready for implementation

## Context

The previous core-generator requirements specification was completed but subsequent analysis revealed critical gaps that make it not ready for implementation. This requirement gathering aims to address the identified blocking issues and create a truly implementable specification.

## Previous Analysis Findings

The specification was marked as "NOT READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION" due to:

1. **Interface Design Conflict (CRITICAL)** - Mismatch between existing code and specification
2. **Missing Critical Dependencies (CRITICAL)** - Required libraries not specified
3. **Incomplete Error Handling Strategy (CRITICAL)** - No failure recovery defined
4. **Missing Testing Strategy (CRITICAL)** - No validation approach
5. **Performance and Scale Considerations (HIGH)** - No large-scale usage guidance

## Objective

Address the critical gaps and create a complete, implementable specification for the core gRPC client generator that can safely proceed to development.
