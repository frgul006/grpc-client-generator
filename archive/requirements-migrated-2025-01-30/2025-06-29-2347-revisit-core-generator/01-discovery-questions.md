# Context Discovery Questions

**Phase:** Discovery  
**Total Questions:** 5

## Q1: Should we prioritize backward compatibility with the existing GeneratorOptions interface?
**Default if unknown:** No (clean break is better than maintaining broken interface)

**Rationale:** The current interface `GeneratorOptions { services: ServiceConfig[] }` conflicts with the specification's file-centric approach. Maintaining compatibility would require complex workarounds that could compromise the design.

## Q2: Should the generator automatically install missing dependencies (ts-proto, ts-morph) during first run?
**Default if unknown:** No (explicit dependency management is more reliable)

**Rationale:** Auto-installation can cause version conflicts and makes dependency management unpredictable. Better to require explicit dependency declaration in package.json.

## Q3: Should the generator support incremental compilation for large proto file sets?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (performance is critical for production adoption)

**Rationale:** Large codebases with many proto files would benefit from only regenerating changed files, similar to how TypeScript compiler works with incremental builds.

## Q4: Should error handling include automatic retry mechanisms for transient failures?
**Default if unknown:** No (fail-fast is more predictable than retry logic)

**Rationale:** Retry logic adds complexity and can mask underlying issues. Better to fail clearly and let build systems handle retries if needed.

## Q5: Should the testing strategy include generated code validation against real gRPC services?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (integration testing ensures real-world compatibility)

**Rationale:** Unit tests alone cannot verify that generated clients work with actual gRPC services. Integration tests provide confidence in the generated code quality.
