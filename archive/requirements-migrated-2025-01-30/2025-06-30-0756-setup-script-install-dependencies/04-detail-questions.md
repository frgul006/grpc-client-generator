# Expert Requirements Questions

These detailed questions clarify specific system behavior now that we understand the codebase structure and patterns.

## Q6: Should each package installation have its own checkpoint in the state file for resume capability?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (follows existing pattern and allows granular resume from any failed package)

## Q7: Should the setup summary at the end show dependency installation status for each package individually?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (provides complete visibility similar to how preflight shows all packages)

## Q8: Should packages with missing or empty package.json files be skipped with a warning rather than failing?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (graceful handling allows setup to continue for other valid packages)

## Q9: Should the npm registry be reset to default after each package installation or only once at the end?
**Default if unknown:** No (reset only once at the end to avoid unnecessary registry switches)

## Q10: Should the function exclude certain directories like 'registry' even if they contain package.json files?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (registry directory is for Verdaccio and shouldn't be treated as a project package)
