# Initial Request: Enhance Preflight UI with Better Progress Feedback

## Source
Ticket: tickets/ticket-04-enhance-preflight-ui-feedback.md

## Summary
Transform the preflight command's verbose output into a clean status dashboard that shows packages progressing through verification stages.

## Key Problems
- Information overload from npm script output
- No progress context or completion indicators  
- Visual fatigue from undifferentiated text
- Mixed output from parallel packages
- Uncertainty about package start/completion
- High cognitive load parsing important information

## Proposed Solution
Create a status dashboard showing:
- Packages as atomic units with state transitions
- Visual progress indicators (‚úÖ üü° ‚è≥)
- Stage-based organization
- In-place updates instead of streaming logs
- Summary view with detailed logs on failure

## Technical Scope
- Modify `cli/lib/preflight.sh` functions
- Implement structured status updates
- Create status renderer with ANSI escape codes
- Filter verbose output while maintaining error details
